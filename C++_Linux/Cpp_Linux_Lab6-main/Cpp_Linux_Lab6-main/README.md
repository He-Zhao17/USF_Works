# Lab 6: Porting to Go

The goal of this lab is simple: to port one of our C labs to golang.

* Choose either Lab 2 or Lab 3 (cipher or query engine). If you do both, you can earn 1 extra credit point.
* Check your .go file(s) into this repository
* Add a writeup (edit this README file) explaining anything that tripped you up, surprised you, or seemed unintuitive. Also explain what you did and didn't like about go.
